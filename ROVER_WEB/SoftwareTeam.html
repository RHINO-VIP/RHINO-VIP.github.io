           The software team are responsible for building the message passing
           system that will be used to communicate between the individual nodes
           of the system. This is done without a central processing node and the
           design allows for the system to continue working even in the result
           of connections between nodes failing.

        <p id="resource"> 
            The resource discovery team's role is to deal with the initial start 
            up of the system. Their code allows each individual node to know what
            data is available on the network, how many node away the data is and
            what serial port on the microcontroller to use to get it.
        </p>
        <p id="specs">
            The message specification team are responsible for setting up and
            maintaining the specification of what is contained in a packet and
            a message. In addition they are responsible for the code which both
            creates these packets for sending and for unpacking them when a node
            receives them.
        </p>
        <p id="passingQueueing">
            The message passing and queueing team are responsible for the code
            that is used when a node receives a message. The aim is that the 
            node can check whether it is for itself or not and whether it is
            part of a larger message. It stores the packets in a buffer until
            the full message is received then passes them to a message queue to
            be executed.
